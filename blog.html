  <h3>Cryptocurrencies</h3>
  <p>Cryptocurrencies are always going to have a problem with valuation - and rightly so, as humans we are programmed to tread with caution. But I think that fine morning in May 2010 when Laszlo paid 10,000 BTC for two Papa John’s pizza, it suddenly became clear even among skeptics, that maybe, just maybe, there is something more to these so called currencies than meets the eye. I call that moment crossing the Rubicon because no matter what anyone says, that moment captures the very tenet of Economics itself. I mean what are currencies really if not an extension of our self proclaimed aggrandisement. If currencies, fiat or otherwise, were created then provided valuation early in our history, then why can’t everything else be?</p>

  <h3>zk Snarks</h3>
  <p>Anonymity. Picture this. Picture  having meaningful transactions and yet you now have an option to conceal your name, age and those pesky demographic characteristics. I’m not just talking about ZCash here though. For example you need your HIV medications and regular check up but when you go to the hospital, you don’t want to tell your name. In this case, the system will automatically only recognize what you want to share (eg. your condition and pertinent laboratory data) and nothing else. There is no more centralized hospital data because now it is the patient who owns and has the data. No more furtive and judgmental glances from hospital staff or those with no business about your health. This application in clinical trials and clinical practice is truly remarkable. Talk about anonymity. Just incredible. </p>

  <h3>Causation versus Association</h3>
  <p>I have always wrestled with the statistical principle that Association is not and should not be equated with Causation - I mean I find the math too linear. Is it possible then that with machine learning, data science and Blockchain and considering all the possible variables, we can finally arrive at the golden truth or at least something close to it?</p>
